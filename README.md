# ALL ABOUT PIZZA API
This is the repository for the start of what I hope will become an API for all things PIZZA!

## TO GET STARTED:

- Fork and clone the repository
- run `npm i` to install dev dependencies
- run 'npm run start' to start the server which runs on port 8000
- go to `localhost:8000/api` in your browser and you should receive a *Hello World* successful response
